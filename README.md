Visual C++ Cleaner
==================

VCC++ cleaner is a small script written in VBScript that automates the cleaning of intermediate files that are normally created when compiling Visual C++ projects.

Its features are -
1. Clean the entire folder (with subdirectories) by entering only the path
2. Clean by extension
3. Clean by folder name (Debug, Release etc.)
4. Built in logging support

Current extensions which are cleaned -
  pch,clw,aps,plg,opt,ncb,scc,ilk,htm,vss,pcx,bkp,bak,bsc,user,suo

Current folders which are cleaned -
  debug, release

This script is extremely flexible and can be used even for system maintenance by making a small change to the script. Include any extensions to be cleaned from the system and the script will take care of the rest.
